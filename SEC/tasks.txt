Tasks:

Imports and load datasets
- decide: combine dfs together or work with each independently? Nr. rows are different AND questions differ across datasets

Data preprocessing
- data cleaning (unbalanced data, Lots of NA, will need to predict NaN for overall_rating)
- data exploration
- regression, XGboost, normalization, decisions on qualitative features

ML & fitting 
- since we're working towards predicting a target of overall_rating, should we use regression or classification? I can see the rating goes up to 10 AND the ratings are discrete, so by technicality this would be classification.
