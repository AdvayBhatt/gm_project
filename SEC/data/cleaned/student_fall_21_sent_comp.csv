2: One of the members of the SEC Career Fair did not allow me to enter because I was wearing tennis shoes. He mentioned that non dress shoes were not allowed. My tennis shoes were black and discreet. They reduce my back pain when standing long hours. Some people get into the fair without blazers or dress shirts and stop people with comfortable discreet shoes? Letting someone in without a suit represents Texas A&M in a lesser way than a pair of tennis shoes. No recruiter is going to be staring at your feet as long as you don’t wear flip flops…
